    "# Introduction to Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a tool designed to simplify the process of setting up, running, and managing applications by using containers. Containers provide a consistent environment across different machines and operating systems, making it easier to share and deploy applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem Docker Solves\n",
    "\n",
    "Replicating the development environment across different machines can be challenging. Here's why Docker is useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependency Management**: Ensuring that all developers have the same versions of dependencies can be tedious. Docker solves this by using container images, which specify exact versions of all dependencies.\n",
    "2. **Operating System Differences**: Containers abstract away differences between operating systems, so you don't have to worry about whether the application will work on Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n",
    "3. **Cloud Deployment**: Docker simplifies deploying applications to the cloud, including handling autoscaling and environment consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Docker Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker uses containers to create isolated environments for running applications. Here's a breakdown of the core concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Containers**: These are lightweight, isolated environments where applications run. They share the host system's kernel but have their own filesystem and libraries.\n",
    "- **Images**: These are the blueprints for containers. An image includes the OS, application code, and dependencies needed to run the application.\n",
    "- **Docker Daemon**: The background service that manages Docker containers, images, and networks.\n",
    "- **Docker Desktop**: A GUI tool that helps manage Docker on your local machine. It includes Docker Daemon and the Docker CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with Docker, you need to install Docker Desktop, which includes both the Docker CLI and Docker Desktop GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Docker Desktop** from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).\n",
    "2. **Install Docker Desktop** by following the installation instructions for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Docker Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some fundamental Docker commands to help you get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Docker Version**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker -v\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run a Container**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker run -it ubuntu\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `-it`: Interactive mode.\n",
    "   - Pulls the `ubuntu` image if not already available.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **List Running Containers**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker ps\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Use `docker ps -a` to list all containers, including stopped ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Start a Stopped Container**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker start {container_name or container_id}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stop a Running Container**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker stop {container_name or container_id}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Execute a Command in a Container**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker exec {container_name} {command}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Use `-it` for interactive mode:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     docker exec -it {container_name} {command}\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **List Local Images**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker images\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Port Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers are isolated and do not expose their ports by default. To access services running inside a container (e.g., a Redis server), you need to map container ports to host ports:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -it -p 6379:6379 {image_name}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `6379:6379`: Maps port 6379 of the container to port 6379 on the host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Passing Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass environment variables to containers using the `-e` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -it -p 1025:1025 -e key=value -e key=value {container_name}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dockerizing an Application\n",
    "\n",
    "To Dockerize an application, you need to create a `Dockerfile`, which contains instructions to build a Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Dockerfile**:\n",
    "   ```dockerfile\n",
    "   # Use an official base image\n",
    "   FROM ubuntu\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Install dependencies\n",
    "   RUN apt-get update\n",
    "   RUN apt-get install -y curl nodejs\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Copy application code\n",
    "   COPY package.json package.json\n",
    "   RUN npm install\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Set the command to run the application\n",
    "   ENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"main.js\"]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build the Docker Image**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker build -t nodejs .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the Docker Image**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker run -it -p 8000:8000 nodejs\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex applications involving multiple services, Docker Compose simplifies the management of multiple containers. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define your application's services:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "version: '3.8'\n",
    "\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  postgres:\n",
    "    image: postgres\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - '5432:5432'\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      POSTGRES_API: api\n",
    "\n",
    "  redis:\n",
    "    image: redis\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - '6379:6379'\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      REDIS_API: api\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start the application stack** with Docker Compose:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo docker-compose up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will pull the necessary images, create containers, and start the services as defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker provides a powerful way to ensure consistency and ease of deployment across different environments by using containers. By following the basic commands and practices outlined above, you can effectively manage and deploy your applications with Docker."

    "**Why Docker?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a person is working on windows 11 and intel processor. For a certain project, he has the following dependencies:\n",
    "    1. Node v16\n",
    "    2. MongoDb 5\n",
    "    3. Redis 6.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "Now another develpoer joins the company after two years, now he wants to run the same code on his machine, but now he has mac \n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem will creating the environment and installing the dependencies, which becomes a tediuos task. But suppose he did all of that and installed all the libraries.\n",
    "But still the dependencies that will be downloaded will not be of the same version as used for the project, because automatically the lates versions wil be installed. Which can create conflicts. So even after installing and creating dependencies and environment, there will be errord.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the he intalls the exact versions of the tools and libs, still there can be errors. As os for both of them are different. There will be some tools which are built for windowas or linux and cannot run on mac and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short Replicating Environment on different machines is difficult, and this is core problem which is solved by docker.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Same with cloud where they want to deploy the application, still they will have to set up the environment and if they are using autoscaling, they will have to do this repitive task again and again. Which is quite difficult and messy. "
